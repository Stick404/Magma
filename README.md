# Magma, a Lisp Interpreter in Java
This interpreter is based on [TinyLisp](https://github.com/amake/TinyLisp/tree/master), and would not be possible without their work.
Magma introduces many optimizations and changes from TinyLisp; these range from using a Registry for adding Functions and Expressions, adding more functions, to personal polishing of the code.

## Usage
`Not recomended`

This is because Magma is currently in development and could possibly be entirely overhauled, so it is not recommended to use Magma in your current projects. However, when Magma is completed, or in LTS, feel free to use in personal and or public projects.
